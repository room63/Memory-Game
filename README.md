**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Zaul Gomez**

Time spent: **16** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I did not use outside sources, only the information on the assignment given by the code path.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[The most challenging part for me is using glitch since exporting the files to GitHub is slightly different from the video since an old version shows it. I overcome this problem by looking up on the internet how to export a project from glitch to Github. Also, the gif tool was a little tricky to use since I used a simple one in my other course of code path, but I managed to understand it.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[One of the questions that I have related to web development is whether it is possible to include code like Java or python in implementing the .script section.
 What kind of frameworks are more suitable for web development, and what kind of frameworks are of IDE are the best options. ]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had more hours, I probably would put the buttons with a 3d design and a more interactive interface for the dashboard. Every time that the user won would appear start, and every time that user lost, I would put phrases like "good luck for the next time" "almost got it" ]
